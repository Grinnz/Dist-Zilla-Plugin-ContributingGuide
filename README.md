# Ideas

## Source

*DATA section as template (Data::Section::Simple)

*Template from sharedir?

*Direct multi-value param template

*Default generic templates - github style for .md output, and more generic otherwise

## Destination

*same options as [ReadmeAnyFromPod] - build or root

*build could be copied to root with [CopyFilesFromBuild]

*root would be pruned from build

*caveat about putting a .pod file in the dist
